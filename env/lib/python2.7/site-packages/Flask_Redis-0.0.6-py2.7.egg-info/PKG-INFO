        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install flask-redis
        
        Or if you *must* use easy_install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            alias easy_install="pip install $1"
            easy_install flask-redis
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Your configuration should be declared within your Flask config. You can declare
        via a Redis URL containing the database
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            REDIS_URL = "redis://:password@localhost:6379/0"
        
        or you are able to declare the following
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            REDIS_URL="redis://:password@localhost:6379"
            REDIS_DATABASE=5
        
        To create the redis instance within your application
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask_redis import Redis
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            redis_store = Redis(app)
        
        or
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask_redis import Redis
        
            redis_store = Redis()
        
            def create_app():
                app = Flask(__name__)
                redis_store.init_app(app)
                return app
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from core import redis_store
        
            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                return redis_store.get('potato','Not Set')
        
        **Protip:** The `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ package currently holds the 'redis' namespace,
        so if you are looking to make use of it, your Redis object shouldn't be named 'redis'.
        
        For detailed instructions regarding the usage of the client, check the `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ documentation.
        
        Advanced features, such as Lua scripting, pipelines and callbacks are detailed within the projects README.
